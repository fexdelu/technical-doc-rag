RAG System Documentation

Introduction
This is a sample document for testing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.
The system is designed to load documents, split them into chunks, create embeddings, and store them in a vector database.

Features
- Document loading from multiple formats (PDF, TXT, MD)
- Intelligent text splitting with overlap
- Vector embeddings using OpenAI
- Pinecone vector store integration
- Efficient retrieval for question answering

Architecture
The system follows a modular architecture with the following components:
1. Config: Manages environment variables and configuration
2. DocumentLoader: Loads documents from the filesystem
3. TextSplitter: Splits documents into manageable chunks
4. Embeddings: Creates vector representations of text
5. VectorStore: Stores and retrieves embeddings
6. RAGPipeline: Orchestrates the entire workflow

Usage
To use the system, simply place your documents in the documents folder and run the main pipeline.
The system will automatically process them and make them available for querying.

Best Practices
- Keep chunk sizes between 256-1024 tokens
- Use overlap to maintain context between chunks
- Regularly update your vector store with new documents
- Monitor embedding costs and optimize as needed

Conclusion
This RAG system provides a robust foundation for building intelligent document retrieval and question-answering applications.
